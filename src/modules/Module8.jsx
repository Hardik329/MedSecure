          <p>
            APIs are vital in modern healthcare infrastructure, enabling
            devices, portals, and databases to communicate securely.
            Misconfigured APIs, however, are one of the biggest sources of data
            breaches in medical IoT.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Medical IoT environments benefit from both real-time monitoring and
            scheduled audits. Real-time monitoring provides instant alerts for
            anomalies, while audits give insights into policy compliance, system
            performance, and long-term security trends.

              <strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Detects and responds to
              threats as they occur. Often uses SIEM (Security Information and
              Event Management) systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Periodic Auditing:</strong> Reviews logs and
              configurations at regular intervals to detect misconfigurations
              and violations.
